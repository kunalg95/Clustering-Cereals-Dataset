# Clustering- Cereals dataset 
On cereals data, I used Agglomerative, k-means clustering to generate patterns, as well as elbow and Silhouette Analysis to find the optimal number of cluster values for a better score.

# Implementation of Dbscan Algorithm
A dataset with three clusters and a 0.5 standard deviation for each cluster is also being created using the dbscan technique. There are 400 samples total, and we also select three sites to serve as centroids (center of clusters). Using the make blobs method, you can change these arguments however you desire. The dataset can also be plotted to examine how each cluster appears. make a DBSCAN object, then fit the data into it.
